### Changed
- Versioning is now aligned with `triblespace` releases.
- Updated consolidate E2E test commits to pass optional metadata explicitly.
- Renamed `id-gen` command to `genid` to align with the GenID schema.

- Removed explanatory comment about crate metadata from `Cargo.toml`.
- Increased default maximum pile size to 16 TiB.
- Fixed `pile put` compilation issues when using memmap.
- Renamed `pile pull` to `pile get` to avoid confusion with repository commands.
- Reworded inventory note about import/export commands to clarify blob
  transfers to piles and object stores via dedicated subcommands.
- Simplified `Pile::open` error handling now that `OpenError` implements
  `std::error::Error` upstream.
- `pile list-blobs` output uses lowercase hex instead of uppercase.
- `pile branch list` output now includes name and head commit in addition to the branch id.
- Pile commands reorganized under `branch` and `blob` subcommands.
- Store commands reorganized under `branch` and `blob` subcommands.
- Simplified file ingestion using `anybytes::Bytes::map_file` and removed
  the `memmap2` dependency.
- Split CLI command groups into modules under `src/cli`.
- Organized pile and store command implementations into submodules matching the CLI hierarchy.
- Consolidated pile-only branch commands under the `pile branch` subcommand.
- Rewrote README with a friendlier tone and clarified command list.
- Corrected pile file extension in README quick-start example.
- Deduplicated blob handle parsing across CLI modules.
- `pile blob put` and `store blob put` now print the blob handle after
  ingestion.
- Split CLI integration tests into smaller modules for readability.
- `pile create` now creates parent directories if they do not exist.
- Updated to latest `tribles` crate and imported required store traits.
