# AGENTS Instructions

The `INVENTORY.md` file collects pending work and ideas for future development.
Whenever you discover or create a task that should be performed later, append it
to that file so it is not forgotten.
Additionally, stay alert for potential improvements when browsing the code and record them in INVENTORY.md.
