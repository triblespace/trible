# Inventory

## Potential Removals
- None at the moment.
## Desired Functionality
- Inspection utilities for listing entities, attributes, and relations, with optional filtering.
- Generate shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish.
- Provide progress reporting for blob transfers and other long-running operations.
- Switch to using the published `tribles` crate on crates.io once available.

## Discovered Issues
- Shared code across CLI modules could be deduplicated into utilities.
